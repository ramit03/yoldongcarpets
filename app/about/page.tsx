          Our Story, Woven in Every Thread
        </h1>
        <p className="max-w-3xl text-base lg:text-lg z-10 text-white">
          Founded in 2000, our family-run business based in Kathmandu, Nepal
          specializes in the manufacturing and export of custom-ordered Tibetan
          hand-knotted carpets. With deep roots in the industry, built over
          years of experience even before we began our own venture, we carry
          forward a tradition of craftsmanship and quality. <br />
          <br /> Each rug we create is custom-made to reflect the evolving
          tastes and unique visions of our clients. In a world where design has
          become more personal and sophisticated, we take pride in blending
          timeless Tibetan techniques with modern sensibilities to craft rugs
          that are both meaningful and enduring.
          <br />
          <br /> We proudly export our rugs from Nepal to clients around the
          world, including countries like the United States and the United
          Kingdom.
